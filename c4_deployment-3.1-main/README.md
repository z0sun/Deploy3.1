The Story
-----------------------------------------
Weâ€™re a tech start-up company with a URL shortener tool. We have a SLA with Nike to provide them access to our URL shortener. In the SLA, we are only allowed 20 minutes of downtime a year. If anything happens to the URL shortener, we must communicate any incidents to Nike.
 
Scenario
-----------------------------------------
A new hire was tasked with updating the URL shortener. The new hire committed version 2 of the application to the main branch. Which automatically triggered a build, test, and deploy to the production server, replacing version 1 of the application running on the server.

Next Steps 
-----------------------------------------
Create a post-incident report. The report must include:
- What was the reason for the incident?
- How long was the site down or malfunctioning?
- What steps were taken to resolve the incident?
- Was the incident fully resolved?
- What steps would you take to prevent this from happening again?
